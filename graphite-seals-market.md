<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphite Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flexible</li><li>Inflexible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flexible graphite seals refer to seals that can easily conform to irregular surfaces, making them versatile and suitable for a wide range of applications. Inflexible graphite seals, on the other hand, are rigid and less pliable, limiting their use to specific applications where a tight seal is required. While flexible graphite seals offer more adaptability and ease of installation, inflexible graphite seals provide a more secure and durable sealing solution for critical applications. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on specific sealing requirements.</p></p>
