<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical X-ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical X-ray Flat Panel Detectors come in two main types: Indirect Conversion and Direct Conversion. Indirect Conversion detectors use a scintillator material to convert X-ray photons into light photons, which are then converted into electrical signals by a photodiode array. On the other hand, Direct Conversion detectors directly convert X-ray photons into electrical signals using a semiconductor material such as amorphous selenium. Both types have their advantages and limitations, and their market share may vary depending on factors like image quality, cost, and application requirements.</p></p>
