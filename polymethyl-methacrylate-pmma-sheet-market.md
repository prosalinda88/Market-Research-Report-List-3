<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Sheet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Sheet</li><li>Extruded Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Sheet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cast Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Sheet is produced by pouring liquid monomer between two sheets of glass and allowing it to cure. This method creates a high-quality product with excellent optical clarity and scratch resistance. On the other hand, Extruded Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Sheet is manufactured by melting resin pellets and pushing them through a die to create flat sheets. This process is more cost-effective and produces sheets with consistent thickness and quality. Both types of PMMA sheets are widely used in various industries for their durability and aesthetic appeal.</p></p>
