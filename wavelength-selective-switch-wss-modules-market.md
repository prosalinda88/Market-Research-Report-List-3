<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wavelength Selective Switch WSS Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LCOS based Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) Modules</li><li>MEMS based Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) Modules</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) Modules are key components in reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer systems. Two main types of WSS modules are LCOS based and MEMS based. LCOS WSS modules use liquid crystal on silicon technology to manipulate the wavelength of incoming light signals, offering high spectral resolution. On the other hand, MEMS WSS modules utilize micro-electromechanical systems to achieve wavelength selectivity, providing fast switching speeds and low insertion loss. Both types of modules play crucial roles in optimizing optical network performance.</p></p>
