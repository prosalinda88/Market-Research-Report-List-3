<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wifi IP Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Camera</li><li>Decentralized IP Camera</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centralized IP cameras rely on a central network video recorder (NVR) or server to manage and store video footage, making them suitable for large-scale surveillance systems. Decentralized IP cameras have built-in storage capabilities, eliminating the need for a central NVR and allowing for easier installation and scalability. Decentralized cameras are more cost-effective for small-scale deployments and offer greater flexibility in terms of placement and network management. Both types of IP cameras offer remote monitoring and management capabilities through a wifi connection.</p></p>
