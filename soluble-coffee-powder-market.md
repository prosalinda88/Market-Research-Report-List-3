<p><p>Soluble coffee powder is commonly produced through two main methods: spray-drying and freeze-drying. In the spray-drying process, the coffee extract is sprayed into hot air, causing the water to evaporate quickly and leaving behind fine coffee particles. This method is more commonly used due to its cost-effectiveness and efficiency. On the other hand, freeze-drying involves freezing the coffee extract and then drying it under vacuum, resulting in a product with better aroma and taste retention, but at a higher cost.</p></p>
