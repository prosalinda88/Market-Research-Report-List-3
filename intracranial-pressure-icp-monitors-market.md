<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitors are devices used to measure the pressure inside the skull. There are two main types of ICP monitors: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive monitors require a procedure to place a sensor directly into the brain, providing the most accurate readings but posing a higher risk of complications. Non-invasive monitors, on the other hand, use external sensors placed on the scalp to indirectly measure ICP. While less risky, non-invasive monitors may not provide as accurate results as invasive ones.</p></p>
