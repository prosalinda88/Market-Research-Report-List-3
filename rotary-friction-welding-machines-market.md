<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Friction Welding Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inertia Rotary Friction Welding</li><li>Continuous Drive Rotary Friction Welding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary friction welding machines are divided into two main types: inertia rotary friction welding and continuous drive rotary friction welding. Inertia rotary friction welding involves one rotating part that is pressed against a stationary part, creating friction that ultimately joins the two parts together. Continuous drive rotary friction welding, on the other hand, involves both parts rotating in the same direction while being pressed together, forming a strong bond through frictional heat. Both types of machines are widely used in various industries for joining different materials with high precision and efficiency.</p></p>
