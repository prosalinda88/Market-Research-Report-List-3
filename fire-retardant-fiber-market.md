<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Retardant Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosphorus-based Fire Retardant Fiber</li><li>Silica-based Fire Retardant Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire retardant fibers are classified into two main types: phosphorus-based and silica-based. Phosphorus-based fire retardant fibers work by forming a protective char layer when exposed to heat or flames, which helps prevent the spread of fire. On the other hand, silica-based fire retardant fibers work by releasing water vapor when exposed to heat, which cools down the material and inhibits combustion. Both types of fire retardant fibers are important in various industries where fire safety is a priority.</p></p>
