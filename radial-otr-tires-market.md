<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial OTR Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inner Tube</li><li>Tubeless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial OTR tires are classified into two main market types based on their construction: Inner Tube and Tubeless. Inner Tube tires consist of a rubber tube inside the tire casing, which holds the air pressure. On the other hand, Tubeless tires lack an inner tube and have a special lining that prevents air from escaping. Both types offer unique advantages and are used in various applications, with Tubeless tires typically being preferred for their lower maintenance and better performance in certain conditions.</p></p>
