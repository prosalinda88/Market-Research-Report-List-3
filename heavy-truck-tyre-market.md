<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Truck Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heavy truck tyres are available in two main types: radial tyres and bias tyres. Radial tyres are constructed with the plies running radially across the tyre, providing greater flexibility and allowing for better heat dissipation. These tyres are known for their longer tread life and improved fuel efficiency. On the other hand, bias tyres are constructed with the plies running diagonally across the tyre. While bias tyres are more durable and provide better load-carrying capacity, they are also less fuel-efficient compared to radial tyres.</p></p>
