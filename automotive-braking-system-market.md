<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc</li><li>Drum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive braking system market consists of two main types: disc brakes and drum brakes. Disc brakes use calipers to clamp down on a rotor to slow or stop the vehicle, providing better heat dissipation and braking performance. On the other hand, drum brakes use brake shoes that press against the inside of a drum to slow or stop the vehicle. While disc brakes are more commonly used in modern vehicles for their superior performance, drum brakes are still found on some vehicles for their simplicity and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
