<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Lifts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pump Assisted</li><li>Gas Assisted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial lifts are used in the oil and gas industry to increase the flow of liquids or gases from a well. Pump-assisted artificial lifts use mechanical pumps to push fluids to the surface, while gas-assisted lifts use gas injection to reduce the weight of the fluid column in the well, allowing for easier extraction. Both types of artificial lifts are crucial for maintaining production rates in aging or low-pressure wells, helping operators maximize recovery rates and extend the lifespan of their assets.</p></p>
