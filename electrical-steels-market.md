<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Steels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oriented Electrical Steels</li><li>Non-Oriented Electrical Steels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrical steels are typically divided into two main types: oriented electrical steels and non-oriented electrical steels. Oriented electrical steels are used in transformers and motors where the magnetic field is required to be aligned in a specific direction. Non-oriented electrical steels, on the other hand, are used in applications where the magnetic field direction is not fixed, such as in rotating machinery like generators and electric motors. Both types of electrical steels play a crucial role in the efficiency and performance of electrical equipment.</p></p>
