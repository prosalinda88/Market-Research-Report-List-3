<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solid Bowl Centrifuge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concurrent Design</li><li>Counter Current Design</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solid Bowl Centrifuges are commonly categorized into two types based on their design - Concurrent Design and Counter Current Design. In Concurrent Design, the solid-laden liquid feed enters the centrifuge at the same end where the clarified liquid exits, resulting in a shorter retention time for solids. Counter Current Design, on the other hand, has the liquid feed entering at one end and moving towards the opposite end, allowing for a longer retention time for solids and improved separation efficiency. Both designs have their own benefits and are chosen based on specific application requirements.</p></p>
