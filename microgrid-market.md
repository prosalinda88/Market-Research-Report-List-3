<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microgrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied</li><li>Independent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grid-Tied Microgrid refers to a system that connects to the main utility grid for backup power or to sell excess energy back to the grid. This type of microgrid is more common and widely used in urban areas. Independent Microgrid, on the other hand, operates autonomously and is disconnected from the main utility grid. It typically relies on local renewable energy sources and energy storage to meet its power needs. Independent microgrids are often found in remote areas or critical infrastructure facilities.</p></p>
