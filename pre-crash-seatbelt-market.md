<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pre-Crash Seatbelt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preload Type Belt</li><li>Preroll Preload Type Belt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Preload type seatbelts use a tensioning system that pulls the belt tight in the event of a crash, reducing the slack and preventing the occupant from moving too much. Preroll preload type seatbelts take this concept a step further by pre-tensioning the belt before a crash occurs, further reducing the risk of injury by minimizing the occupant's movement upon impact. Both of these market types aim to improve the effectiveness of seatbelts in preventing injury in the event of a collision.</p></p>
